BANKNUE TYPEFACE
By Twinbrush

***PLEASE NOTE***
Although BankNue is an all uppercase font you can type with caps lock on or off, or with your software's character panel set to upper or lowecase. However DO NOT mix cases when typing as this may result in unwanted letterspace (tracking and kerning) anomolies. 

In other words, for optimum results please type ONLY in one case: Uppercase or lowercase.

HOW TO QUICK USE GUIDE:

***Please follow the recommended method for installing fonts on your operating system. Do not install duplicates or mutliple formats of the same font i.e  Do not install both .otf and .ttf formats if both are supplied***

Below is a quick outline of how to get the most out of the BANK Typeface. 

Firstly, as a display font, BANKNUE is specifically designed to have more impact at larger sizes, although it is legible in smaller point sizes, go big to allow the layered nature of the type to show through.

No matter what software you use, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop etc the technique for applying a colour offset look (like the main feature image) is the same:

1. Using BankNue-Lined, type the text content you need. At this stage add any tracking or kerning (that's letterspacing by the way) adjustments you feel are required to achieve the look you want.
2. Duplicate this type layer (or copy and 'paste in place') and change the font to BankNue-Sectioned.
3. Pick/select a colour and set the layer blending mode to 'Multiply' (or adjust the opacity settings if you wish, Mutiply works well though).
4. Duplicate this BankNue-Sectioned type layer and move it below the other two in the layer stack.
5. Pick/select a new colour for this layer (again I suggest having the layer blending mode set to 'Multiply' but feel free to experiment).
6. Using the selection tool (black arrow), and the arrow keys on your keyboard, nudge this bottom layer to the left and down to achieve an offset/drop-shadow appearance). Obviously you can move this layer to the right, or up, or wherever...and move it using your mouse or stylus/pen; but the above steps outline how the font was specifically intended to be used..but you're free to experiment and play around!
